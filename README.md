# Listing-and-creating-items-in-a-CRUD
Purpose: With this assignment, you will continue building the abilities needed to create simple apps using REST APIs. You will create a list of "items" to manage on a simulated backend, then make the UI to list existing items and create new ones.  

Important: This is a challenging assignment. Start early and give yourself enough time to finish it!

Task: 

Use a free CRUD API to create a list of items of your choosing. It can be anything: books, people in a company, articles in an e-commerce website...
Use https://beeceptor.com/Links to an external site. (free, recommended) or https://crudapi.co.uk/Links to an external site..
Make sure your simulated API returns JSON objects.
Create at least ten items.
Your items should have at least five elements.
For example: you could have a list of books. Each book could have a name, author, editorial, edition, number of pages, topic(s)...
Create a homepage for your app that will list many items coming from your API. 
For example: the homepage would list the list of books available, by name.
You can, but do not need to, list other elements here. 
When clicking each item on the homepage, you should show, on another page that you will also create, the complete data for this item. This must also come from your API. 
For example: when clicking a book name on the homepage, another page opens with all of the information for this book: name, author, editorial, etc. 
On the homepage, create a button for "create". Clicking on this button opens another page that you will create. This page will contain a form to create a new item. When submitting the form, the page should submit the creation request through the API.
For example: the button says "create a new book". The form contains inputs for name, author, editorial, edition, number of pages, and topics.
The form must be appropriately validated, as it makes sense for each case.
After clicking the "submit" button, it should be possible to go back to the homepage and verify that the new item was added.
The page must have semantic HTML and acceptable CSS to make it user-friendly. (No need to make it fancy.)

Using fetch() is recommended, but you may use other methods to consume data from APIs if you research them.

You will provide: the URL of the GitHub repository with the needed files. The files must work as is. 

Examples:

(to be provided later)
Criteria:

The files must work as is. No broken links, etc.
We will download the repository files and they must work in our local computers.
Valid HTML and CSS.
The pages must get and post data to the API. No static data accepted. A page that does not get data from APIs will mean 0 points in this assignment.
